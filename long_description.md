This application enables the transcription of archive cards from the Egypt Exploration Society (EES) excavations at Armant 
between 1928 - 1929. Images will be drawn from the EES Flickr feed and redisplayed in the browser window. The EES would 
like the following information to be transcribed for them to create a searchable archive for their records. 

These fields are:

* Season number
* Description
* Date of record
* Site code
* Scale or size
* Distribution/ Museum sent to
* Your comments or other information

The object cards have been scanned by EES volunteer Louise Atherton as part of the 2014 - 2015 volunteer projects.
